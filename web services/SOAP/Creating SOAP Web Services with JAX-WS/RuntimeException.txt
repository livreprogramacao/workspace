java.lang.RuntimeException: 
javax.annotation.processing.FilerException: 
Attempt to recreate a file for type org.mano.produto.entity.Product_ 

Having two persistence units using the same Entity class did seem to be the problem.

In my case I had one unit for querying data and the other for authentication. The one for authentication does not need to know about my Entity classes, so in Netbeans I had to uncheck the "Include All Entity Classes in "MyWebServiceProject" Module".
Or add:

    <exclude-unlisted-classes>true</exclude-unlisted-classes>

to the web.xml file for that persistence unit.
